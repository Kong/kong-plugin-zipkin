1.0.0 - 2020-03-09

This version of the plugin has changed enough to be named 1.0.0.

One of the biggest differences from previous versions is that it
is independent from opentracing, while still being compatible with
Zipkin (#64). This allowed simplifying the plugin code and removing
3 external dependencies.

New features:
  - Handling of B3 single header (#66)

Fixes:
  - Stopped tagging non-erroneous spans with `error=false` (#63)
  - Changed the structure of `localEndpoint` and `remoteEndpoint` (#63)
  - Store annotation times in microseconds (#71)
  - Prevent an error triggered when timing-related kong variables
    were not present (#71)
